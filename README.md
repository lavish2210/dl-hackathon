# Class-Conditional Image Generation using Diffusion Models
![Screenshot 2024-04-28 201121](https://github.com/lavish2210/dl-hackathon/assets/90788942/1cad0f36-a467-4faf-b2f0-018aa154b197)


## Description
This repository contains the implementation of class-conditional image generation models for two diverse datasets: alphanumeric characters and animal images across ten distinct classes. These models were developed as part of a 24-hour hackathon, trained on proprietary datasets, and deployed on a Django web server environment. Users can input prompts to generate corresponding images, showcasing the seamless integration of deep learning and web development technologies.
